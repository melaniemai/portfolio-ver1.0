                                        <p>My name is Melanie Mai and I am a third-year student at the University of
                                            Cincinnati pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science.</p>
                                        <p>I love enhancing my hard and soft skills by getting involved in different
                                            environments whether that be joining an organization at school, gaining work
                                            experience, or developing new projects in my free time.</p>
                                        <p>
                                            I am a big advocate for minorities and Womxn in STEM and I have been able to emphasize
                                            the importance of females in tech/engineer through the organizations at UC I am involved 
                                            with. I am currently involved in The Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers (SASE) as 
                                            President, and I am a Bearcat Coder tutor for ACM-W at UC. 
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Through the University of Cincinnati's Co-op program for Engineers, I've been
                                            able to gain real-world experience in the tech industry. I have done two
                                            co-op rotations at Siemens Digitial Industries, working extensively in
                                            Python, C++, and Java.
                                            I was able to apply my programming knowledge with Siemens' own software
                                            applications, Simcenter and NX, to help other engineers and customers work
                                            with ease.</p>
                                        <p>When I'm not in the office working or in my bedroom learning, I enjoy
                                            practicing yoga and meditation, finding new coffee recipes, baking, and
                                            exploring town for the best food spots.</p>
                                        <p>Feel free to reach out to me at any time, I am always interested in new
                                            information and opportunities!</p>

                                    <li>During this co-op rotation, I have learned much more about Meshing and Geometric
                                        Abstraction.
                                        The work I have done emphasized on details, such as identifying short edges on a
                                        body part. Being
                                        detailed in your work not only makes the work I create easier to understand, but
                                        being detailed
                                        helps other engineers and customers work more efficiently based on my detailed
                                        work.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>During this rotation, I've also been able to gain informative and insightful
                                        advice from some of my coworkers.
                                        I've learned that in any workplace, you should be humble and have humility. My
                                        manager has been able to share
                                        with me some that advice from his experience in the workplace. Some of the best
                                        engineers are those who aren't

                                        and they're also open to receiving help. Since they are able to get different

                            <p><em>Milford, OH </em></p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Reduced Scrum team's technical debt by replacing an outdated API with a new API
                                        in over 20 files using C++.</li>
                                    <li>Implemented consistent formatting and better readability to over 20 different
                                        user-facing information windows for new API.</li>
                                    <li>Facilitated in porting team owned files to main codebase by modifying more than
                                        50 files to meet new file naming standards and code compatibility in C++.</li>
                                    <li>During this co-op rotation, I worked heavily with C++. Although prior to starting
                                        the rotation, I had knowledge and hands-on experience with the programming language
                                        through CS courses at UC. While on co-op, I was able to enhance my C++ skills, and 
                                        learn how to apply them to contribute to sophisticated and professional code for a 
                                        large company. By getting a more professional hands-on experience with C++, I have
                                        been better equiped with the knowledge of how the programming language works.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Since this co-op rotation was my first of five, there were many things I was unsure
                                        about while transitioning from a school-based environment to a more professional industry environment. 
                                        One of the more prominent things I had learned was about 
                                        impostor syndrome. During the beginning of the rotation I was struggling with impostor
                                        syndrome but thanks to my coworkers, mentor, and manager, I was able to overcome it. 
                                        They taught me that making mistakes was okay and part of being a student. They also 
                                        reminded me that I was in the company for a reason and my I shouldn't be ashamed or
                                        embarrassed of my coding or communication skills. I was learning everything during my 
                                        time on co-op. I tried to identify my priorities and figure out what I wanted to get 
                                        out of my first co-op. I wanted to become a better developer and part of getting better meant 
                                        I shouldn't be afraid to ask questions and I should talk with my mentor when I was 
                                        struggling with work.

                                        Once the total tuition has been determined, the student will be able to input
                                        the amount of money to pay toward their tuition.

                                        I created this application to get familiar with OOP in Java since I haven't had much experience before. Through this 
                                        application, I was able to better understand objects, classes, constructors, and encapsulation. 
                                        All of these concepts are vital to OOP.

                                        The new email comes with a new password created by the application, but can be changed by the hire along with their mailbox capacity. The code creates one email 
                                        for testing purposes. The new email object will display the new hire's name, company email, and mailbox capacity.

                                        my familiarize myself with the language again. I also got to learn more about OOP in Java as the application utilizes
                                        classes and objects.

                                        The goal of the project was to demonstrate the basic design, creation, and implementation of C++. 
                                        The project is a one-way Battleship game where the player (user) is face with a 9x9 board. The ships
                                        are randomly placed on the board and the user is to input the coordinates of their locations. The user

                                        I also gained a better understanding of OOP in C++ using classes to solve problems and understand code better. 
                                        The concepts learned in class were reinforced through the game creation.

                                <p> I joined this organization because I believe and admire SASE's mission:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>- Prepare Asian heritage scientists and engineers for success in the
                                            global business world.

                                        <li>- Celebrate diversity on campuses and in the workplace.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>- Provide opportunities for members to make contributions to their local
                                            communities.
                                        </li>

                                    As the President of the Cincinnati chapter of the Society of Asian Scientists
                                    and Engineers, I lead a cabinet of five executive officers and hold biweekly
                                    board meetings to ensure there is efficient delegation of duties.
                                    During my time as President, I have been able to increase our student membership
                                    by 21% by leading effective general body meetings. Our general body meetings are
                                    designed to encourage Asian heritage students communicate
                                    with other engineers and provide resources for students to find internships and
                                    professional opportunities. By joining this organization, I have been able to
                                    network with other scientists and engineers from all over the country.
                                    I have learned there is a supportive Asian-heritage community of scientists and
                                    engineers that are dedicated to helping one another grow personally and
                                    professionally. I've learned how to communicate with a variety of people, and
                                    understand the importance of minorities in the workplace.

                                During my time as Secretary, I had learned how to effectively communicate with others. I worked not only with the executive board
                                for the Cincinnati chapter, but other chapters across the country including OSU SASE, SASE KU, and SASE TAMU. I had learned that effective
                                communication leads to great teamwork and through great teamwork, many things can be accomplished. I had been able to network with so many different
                                students from different schools through SASE conferences and have met a hand-full of great leaders from P&G, ExxonMobil, the Federal Bureau of

                            <p> Living in an area in Southwest Ohio with little to no resources about software development and tech made my academic journey to CS very interesting. When I was a teenager, I took interest 
                                in web development and began my "coding" journey as a self-taught learner. By the time college applications came around, my interest in coding had grew immensely. Everyone around me 
                                suggested I take up Computer Science as my major. I didn't get into the Computer Science program when I first transferred to UC. I ended up being in their Exploratory program 
                                and though I was disappointed, I didn't let it deter me. I went through the required engineering classes, practiced my coding skills in my free time, and even tried to get online 
                                certifications. I eventually made it into the CS program and the rest is history. I've taken interesting CS classes such as Data Structures, Python Programming, and Discrete Structures. I've 
                                met some incredible people along my academic journey and it doesn't stop there. UC's Co-op program for Engineers has allowed me to get hands-on experience in the professional tech
                                industry. I've been able to apply my coding skills to the projects I've done at Siemens while gaining new knowledge from my coworkers. I also had an amazing mentor at Siemens who 
                                really let me grow personally and professionally.
                            </p>
                            <p> My time at Siemens has really impacted my journey as a CS student. I already had interest in full-stack development but the team I was on at Siemens dealt with Meshing and 
                                Geometric Abstraction. Coming into my co-op I didn't know what meshing and abstraction had to do with coding, nor did I know what meshing and abstraction was in general, but 
                                thanks to my co-op, I had the opportunity to be exposed to different career paths in CS. I've become more open-minded about my future and what I would like to do.
                            </p>

                                Although my co-op came with great and knowledgable experience, it also came with frustrations. During the first few weeks of my co-op, I felt very small and frustrated with
                                myself. I was working on projects and felt as if my coding skills weren't up to par with everyone else at the company. I was setting high goals for myself that I couldn't 
                                reach. I wanted to be able to do projects on my own without the help of my mentor. I wanted to impress my coworkers and be independent. It was frustrating when I couldn't reach 
                                those goals as a student on her first co-op. I just wanted to do well, but I realized my version of "doing well" was going to be almost impossible since I've never been in a 
                                professional tech environment before, not to mention I was new to the company. I learned that being a "skilled" developer and a great team member takes time. It also takes throwing 
                                away my shyness and not being afraid to ask questions. It takes making mistakes and failures to truly allow myself to find the right path I should be on.
                                If there's one thing I would do differently during my first co-op, it would be to stop worrying about not being the best developer or trying to impress everyone. I should focus on
                                my skills and how to improve myself and not how to impress others.

                                I've completed two co-ops so far and my plan for the remaining co-ops I have is to truly find what career path I want to take prior to graduating, along with strengthening my 
                                hard and soft skills. I hope to create more complex projects to showcase my skills, and I really hope to have fun along the way.
